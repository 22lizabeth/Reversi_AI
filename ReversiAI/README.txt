To run in command line, type:

python reversi_python_client.py localhost playerNum gameTime

**localhost can be replaced with a server IP address
**playerNum is either 1 or 2 only
**gameTime is the number of minutes the game will run for (this should be the same argument passed into the Reversi server)
